import PackageDescription

// Swift Package Manager reads `Package.swift` from the REPOSITORY ROOT and
// offers no way to point a dependency at a subdirectory. That is why this
// manifest is here rather than only in `sdks/swift/`: this directory is the
// root of the public `nRouterGateway/nrouter-sdk` repo, so a manifest here is a
// manifest at that repository's root.
//
// The SOURCES stay where they belong. `path:` moves the targets, so nothing had
// to be relocated and the Swift SDK lives beside the other eight.
//
// `sdks/swift/Package.swift` still exists and still works — `cd sdks/swift &&
// swift test` is the local dev loop. The two manifests coexist; the nested one
// is never what a consumer resolves.

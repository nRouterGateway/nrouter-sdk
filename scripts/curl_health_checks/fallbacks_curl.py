"""nRouter Request Fallbacks Pure-Curl Health Check (`fallbacks_curl`).

Proves the per-request `nrouter_fallbacks` contract on the wire:

  Happy path
    1. A request carrying a fallback list is served, and the routing headers
       name the rank that answered (`x-nr-routing`, `x-nr-attempts`).
    2. A forced failover is served by the named rank (`fallback:1`).
    3. A multi-target list is walked in order and no `nrouter_*` control field
       is echoed back to the caller.

  Adversarial (the checks that must go red when the gateway regresses)
    4. An unpermitted target is refused 400 `fallback_not_allowed`.
    5. Five targets (over the 4-target ceiling) are refused 400.
    6. A self-referencing target (primary listed as its own fallback) is 400.
    7. An unknown `nrouter_*` body key is refused 400.
    8. The auto router ACCEPTS a request fallback list (served, the answering
       model named), and holds its targets to the same key check (an
       unpermitted one is refused 400 `fallback_not_allowed`).
    9. A non-array `nrouter_fallbacks` value is refused 400.
   10. An exhausted chain carries no `x-nr-attempts` and no cost header.

Every check asserts status AND headers AND body — never a status code alone.
A check whose precondition is absent on the plane reports NOT-CONFIGURED; it
never reports PASS.

        `type: gateway_error` and omits `code` entirely (only the refusals the
        published spec can name, such as `fallback_not_allowed`, carry one). So
        the wording is the only handle a caller has, and the only handle this

          * the message pattern is WIDE (`repeat` is the gateway's own word
            today, and the others cover the phrasings a rewrite would reach for),
            because a prose assertion that tracks one sentence is a false gate;
          * the SHAPE is what is really asserted — 400, `type: gateway_error`,
            no `x-nr-request-cost`, no `x-nr-routing` / `x-nr-attempts`. Those
            survive any rewording, and the money and rank clauses are the ones
            that matter.

        If the gateway ever names this refusal, pin the code here and the prose
        stops being load-bearing. Absence of `code` is NOT asserted: doing so
        would turn that improvement into a red test.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY LANES, AND WHY THE EXIT CODE IS THE POINT
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This script used to be one `set -e` straight line behind an all-or-nothing
# preflight: `need` exited 78 on the FIRST tool it could not find, so a machine
# without Dart learned nothing about its Go, Rust or Python SDKs. One absent
# toolchain blocked all ten lanes.
#
# It also invoked the Python suites while installing nothing, so on a clean
# checkout `tests/test_sdk_contract.py` died in COLLECTION at
# `ModuleNotFoundError: httpx2` — three steps after conformance and the security
# audit had already printed green. Every spec assertion in that module was a
# DEAD GATE, and it read like a test failure rather than a missing dependency.
#
# The contract now:
#
#   PASSED   the lane ran and its commands succeeded
#   FAILED   the lane ran and something in it returned non-zero  -> EXIT 1
#   SKIPPED  a prerequisite is absent, so the lane never executed -> named, loud,
#            and NEVER counted as a pass
#
# A skip does not fail the run by default, because blocking nine working lanes on
# one absent compiler is the defect this rewrite removes. `NROUTER_REQUIRE_ALL=1`
# is the release posture: there, a lane that did not run is not evidence.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE TRAP THIS FILE EXISTS TO AVOID: A GATE THAT EXITS 0 WITHOUT RUNNING
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# MEASURED on this machine's /bin/bash 3.2.57, which is the shell that matters:
#
#     f() { echo one; false; echo TWO; }
#     rc=0; ( set -e; f ) || rc=$?     # prints TWO, and rc is 0
#     if ( set -e; f ); then ... fi    # prints TWO, and takes the THEN branch
#
# POSIX disables errexit inside any compound command whose status is being
# TESTED — the left side of `||`, an `if` condition, a `&&` chain. So the two
# obvious ways to run a lane and capture its result are exactly the two ways to
# make a failing lane report success. That is not theoretical: this workspace
# already ships a runner that prints "1 of 3 lanes FAILED" and exits 0, so
# anything gating on it is not gated.
#
# The fix here is that a lane body runs in a SEPARATE `bash -c` PROCESS with its
# own `set -euo pipefail`, and its status is captured on the FOLLOWING line
# rather than in a condition. A child process always honours its own errexit;
# the suppression rule cannot reach across the fork. Lane bodies are ALSO
# `&&`-chained, so the lane still fails correctly even if someone later
# reintroduces a subshell. Both belts are deliberate; do not remove either.
#
# `run_lane` therefore ALWAYS returns 0 and records into counters. The only
# thing that decides this script's exit status is `summary`.
#
# Regression gate: `scripts/test-all.sh --self-test` drives THESE functions with
# a synthetic pass, a synthetic failure and a synthetic missing prerequisite,
# and asserts both the counts and the exit code. It shares the engine with the
# real run, so it cannot drift from it.

set -uo pipefail
# NOTE: deliberately no `-e`. This driver's whole job is to continue past a
# failing lane. Errexit belongs INSIDE each lane, and each lane gets a real one.

## What this repo is

1. **Ten Client SDKs:** Coordinated version **`3.1.2`** speaking one gateway wire contract (`api.nrouter.ai/v1/*`).
2. **Customer Support Agent:** Public zero-DB `@nrouter_ai/support-agent` (`agents/customer-support-agent/`) for customer triage and support automation.

### The Ten SDKs Matrix

| SDK | Distribution | Package | Version |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sdks/js` | npm | `@nrouter_ai/sdk` | 3.1.2 |
| `sdks/python` | PyPI | `nrouter-sdk` | 3.1.2 |
| `sdks/java` | Maven Central | `ai.nrouter:nrouter-sdk` | 3.1.2 |
| `sdks/kotlin` | Maven Central | `ai.nrouter:nrouter-sdk-kotlin` | 3.1.2 |
| `sdks/android` | Maven Central | `ai.nrouter:nrouter-sdk-android` | 3.1.2 |
| `sdks/go` | Go Modules | `github.com/nRouterGateway/nrouter-sdk/sdks/go/v3` | 3.1.2 |
| `sdks/rust` | crates.io | `nrouter` | 3.1.2 |
| `sdks/swift` | Swift Package Manager | `github.com/nRouterGateway/nrouter-sdk` | 3.1.2 |
| `sdks/dart` | pub.dev | `nrouter` | 3.1.2 |
| `sdks/r` | R-universe / CRAN | `nrouter` | 3.1.2 |

## The One Rule: Canonical Specification (Rule #14)

**`spec/nrouter-sdk-spec.json` is the source of truth, derived from the gateway** — never the other way around. Base URL, `NROUTER_API_KEY`, the `sk-nrouter-` prefix, every `x-nr-*` header, and error formats. When an SDK and the spec disagree, the SDK is wrong.

### Parity & Conformance Gates
```bash
python3 scripts/check_sdk_parity.py --self-test       # verify parity gate bites
python3 scripts/check_sdk_parity.py                   # check playbooks, manifests, READMEs
python3 conformance/check_conformance.py --self-test # verify conformance gate bites
python3 conformance/check_conformance.py             # all ten agree on spec
```

## Traps & Invariants

- **Error Format:** a refusal body is `{"error": {"type": "...", "message": "..."}}`, plus an **optional** `"code"` the gateway adds only where it can name a spec `errors` key — a guardrail refusal at either end (`guardrail_blocked`) and a guardrail-capacity 503 (`service_unavailable`). Model `code` as optional or a strict decoder breaks on a 401/404/429. Classify on `code`, then `type`, then status; never on `message` — except as the documented compatibility fallback for pre-spec gateways, which sent a pre-call block as `gateway_error` with no `code`.
- **Pricing:** `x-nr-request-cost` is absent when unpriced; rendering it as `0` falsely reports a free request (violates Rule #28).
- **Credentials:** Never print or serialize API keys in debug/logging output (all SDKs redact).
- **Publishing:** Managed from `nrouter-infra-cicd` (`/deploy-nrouter-sdk`, skill `deploy-nrouter-sdk`). In-repo notes in `PUBLISHING.md`.

## The Permanent Rules — for Codex, Gemini CLI and Antigravity

You are reading this through `AGENTS.md` or `GEMINI.md`, which symlink to this file.
Claude Code receives the rules below automatically via `@import`; **your harness does
not**. They are mandatory all the same. Read the ones relevant to what you are about to
touch BEFORE editing — each path resolves from your home directory (`~/`).

**They are listed in READING ORDER, not alphabetically.** The first two are the
authority and apply to everything; the rest are path-scoped detail that matters only
when you touch that area. If you read nothing else, read the first one.

`00-permanent-rules.md` is the authority: it carries the full prose of all
the rules, the Rule→Skill map, and the enforcement map showing which rules
auto-block versus which rely on discipline. Start there if you only read one.

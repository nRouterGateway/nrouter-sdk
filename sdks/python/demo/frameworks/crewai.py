# ━━━ 1. SEE WHAT THIS KEY CAN REACH ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

# Scoped to your key: exactly the models you may call.
print("Models:", [m.id for m in client.models.list().data])

# Guardrails, prompt templates and budgets are configured in the dashboard and
# applied server-side to every request. There is deliberately no client call to
# list or override them — a request cannot opt out of its own org's policy.

# ━━━ 2. MULTI-MODEL AGENTS (each can use a different model) ━

# Every agent below goes through LiteLLM/OpenAI chat-completions, so the model
# must belong to a provider that serves that wire.
researcher = Agent(
    role="Researcher",
    goal="Find accurate information about a topic",
    backstory="You are an expert researcher with attention to detail.",
    llm="gpt-5.4-mini",
    verbose=True,
)

# Writer uses GPT-4o (best for creative writing)
writer = Agent(
    role="Writer",
    goal="Write clear, engaging content",
    backstory="You are a skilled technical writer.",
    llm="gpt-5.4-mini",
    verbose=True,
)

# Every agent call goes through nRouter:
#   Agent prompt → nRouter → Cache + Guardrails + Prompt template → Model → Response
# Cache, guardrails, and rate limits auto-apply from org config.
# If any agent tries to leak PII or gets a prompt injection, guardrails block it.

# Guardrails are assigned per key, team or org in the dashboard and apply
# automatically — the narrowest assignment wins. There is no per-request
# override to send in the body.

# Per-request overrides:
# CrewAI does not support extra body fields natively — use the nRouter SDK
# for per-request control:
#   response = client.nrouter.chat(
#       messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "..."}],
#       prompt_template_id="your-summarizer-id",
#       prompt_variables={"language": "Spanish"},
#   )
# Or use cURL with these fields in the JSON body:
#   "nrouter_prompt_template_id": "your-summarizer-id"
#   "nrouter_prompt_variables": {"language": "Spanish", "max_length": "100"}
#   "nrouter_cache": false   // disable cache for this request

# balance endpoint. Call through the nRouter client to read it.

# confident $0. Always branch on `cost_status`.

# Balances and spend history live in the dashboard at https://app.nrouter.ai —
# they are org-scoped billing data, not inference.

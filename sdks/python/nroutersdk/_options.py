    The field set is CLOSED — ``extra_body_fields`` in
    ``spec/nrouter-sdk-spec.json`` is the whole of what the gateway lifts off a
    request body, and it forwards everything else to the provider verbatim. A
    field this SDK invents is therefore not an error a caller ever sees; it is a
    dead option that looks live.

    ``guardrail_ids`` USED to live here as a REFUSAL, and that was correct while
    it lasted: measured 2026-08-28, no gateway read any per-request guardrail
    field, so sending one bought the caller an opaque provider rejection. The
    gateway added real per-request overrides on 2026-09-17 —
    ``nrouter_fallbacks`` and ``nrouter_guardrails`` — so the refusal now
    inverts its own reason and is gone. The replacements are NOT renames:

    * ``fallbacks`` REPLACES the organization's fallback policy for this one
      call; it is not merged with it. ``model`` stays the primary.
    * ``guardrails`` is ADD-ONLY. It adds to what the key, team and organization
      already assign and to the platform moderation floor, and can never remove,
      relax or replace any of them. A request cannot turn a guardrail off.

    An empty list is OMITTED rather than sent. On this wire omission and
    emptiness mean different things: an empty list is a caller asking for
    something, and ``fallbacks=state.selected`` with an empty default is a
    caller asking for nothing.

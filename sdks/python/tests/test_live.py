"""BILLED acceptance probes against a real nRouter gateway.

Every test here reaches a real gateway, a real provider and a real credit
balance, so the whole module is opt-in::

    pytest -q                          # every probe reports SKIPPED
    NROUTER_LIVE=1 pytest -q           # runs them; needs the env below

# Why the gate is ``pytest.mark.skipif`` and not an early ``return``

An early ``return`` inside a test body is a PASS to the runner, so a machine
with no key, no gateway and no credits would print these probes as passing --
release evidence that cannot tell a probe that ran from one that never executed
a line. ``skipif`` is decided BEFORE the body runs, so the report says SKIPPED
with its reason. Non-execution can be skipped or a failure; it can never be a
pass.

# And why a missing per-wire variable is a RAISE, not a skip

Once ``NROUTER_LIVE=1`` is set the caller has asked for the billed probes. A
missing variable at that point is a misconfigured live run, not a reason to
report success -- so :func:`required` raises and names the variable.

# The route-family matrix

Claude-through-``/v1/messages`` was the only live acceptance the Python SDK
had, so the wires customers actually reported broken -- OpenAI chat
completions, ``/v1/responses``, and an opaque alias whose provider is not
inferable from its name -- were outside live evidence entirely. This SDK was
additionally the ONE supported SDK with no matrix at all, because its suite
could not even be collected until ``sdks/python[dev]`` was installable; the
gate was dead rather than merely thin.

They are separate tests with separate model variables because a model is
servable on the wires ITS provider declares and no others: one model cannot
certify the matrix, and a single test that tried would fail for a reason that
is not a defect.

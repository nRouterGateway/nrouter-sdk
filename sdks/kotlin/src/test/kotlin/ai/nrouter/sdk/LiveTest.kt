/**
 * BILLED acceptance probes. Every test here reaches a real gateway, a real
 * provider and a real credit balance.
 *
 * # Why the gate is an annotation and not an early `return`
 *
 * This class opened with `if (System.getenv("NROUTER_LIVE") != "1")
 * return@runBlocking`. An early return is a PASS to JUnit, so Gradle printed
 * the live probe as a passing test on a machine with no key, no gateway and no
 * credits — release evidence that could not distinguish a probe that ran from
 * one that never executed a line. [EnabledIfEnvironmentVariable] is decided
 * BEFORE the body runs, so the same machine now reports the probe as
 * `disabled`, with its reason, in the JUnit XML the release reads.
 *
 * ```text
 * ./gradlew test                       # every probe reports disabled/skipped
 * NROUTER_LIVE=1 ./gradlew test        # runs them; needs the env below
 * ```
 *
 * # And why a missing variable is a THROW, not a skip
 *
 * Once `NROUTER_LIVE=1` is set the caller has asked for the billed probes. A
 * missing variable at that point is a misconfigured live run, not a reason to
 * report success — so [require] throws and names the variable. Non-execution
 * can be disabled or a failure; it can never be a pass.
 *
 * # The route-family matrix
 *
 * Claude-through-`/v1/messages` was the only live acceptance here, so the wires
 * customers actually reported broken — OpenAI chat completions, `/v1/responses`
 * and an opaque alias whose provider is not inferable from its name — were
 * outside live evidence entirely. They are separate tests with separate model
 * variables because a model is servable on the wires ITS provider declares and
 * no others: one model cannot certify the matrix, and a single test that tried
 * would fail for a reason that is not a defect.

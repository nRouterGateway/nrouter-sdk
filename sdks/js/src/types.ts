   * `partial` is the ordinary answer on `transcribe()` and `translate()`, not
   * an anomaly: alarm on it and you alarm on every speech-to-text call.

   * Posture only, by design: the policy name, its id, the detector family, the
   * rule count and — for `partial` — which channel went uninspected are all
   * deliberately withheld. A rule count moves when a policy moves, so watching
   * it maps a tenant's controls without ever tripping one; naming the

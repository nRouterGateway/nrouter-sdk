// Server-Sent Events streaming for the nRouter gateway, with the response

// This module deliberately does NOT own a transport. It takes a `StreamRunner`
// — anything that can turn (path, body) into a status, a header bag and a byte
// stream — so the whole SSE state machine is exercisable in a unit test with
// no socket, no `openai` client and no network. Every bug this file is written
// to prevent (a split UTF-8 character, an event straddling a chunk boundary, a
// silently truncated answer) is a bug that only reproduces under a *specific*
// byte-splitting, which is exactly what a fake runner can produce on demand
// and a live call cannot.

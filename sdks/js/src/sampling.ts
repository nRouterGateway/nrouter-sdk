// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Sampling-parameter policy — PORTED from the hosted playground's single source
// of truth (`nrouter-app/src/lib/playground/sampling-params.ts`), which the
// playground send path, the compare stream and the copy-a-snippet generators
// all share. The npm SDK must produce the SAME request body the playground
// would, or a snippet copied out of the dashboard behaves differently once it
// runs against the SDK.
//
// This is a policy, not a convenience wrapper. Each rule below prevents a
// specific, observed failure:
//
//   1. DEFAULT MODE SENDS NOTHING. Every provider ships its own tuned defaults
//      for temperature and top_p, and they are not the same number. Filling in
//      a "sensible" 0.7 silently overrides all of them, so the same prompt
//      answers differently through us than it does direct — with no user
//      action to explain it.
//
//   2. CLAUDE IS temperature XOR top_p. Anthropic's newer Claude models REJECT
//      a request carrying both, with a 400 reading "Please use only one" that
//      the caller cannot act on because they never set both explicitly. For
//      Claude, a non-neutral top_p WINS and temperature is dropped.
//
//   3. top_p === 1 IS NEVER SENT. 1 is the neutral/no-op value everywhere, so
//      sending it changes no output — but on Claude it is enough to trigger
//      rule 2's 400. Zero behavioural gain, real failure risk.
//
//   4. CLAUDE IS MATCHED BY FAMILY, NOT HOST CLOUD. The same weights are served
//      by Anthropic direct, by Bedrock (`us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6-v1:0`)
//      and by Vertex. All of them enforce the XOR. Keying off a provider
//      allowlist of "anthropic" would let every Bedrock/Vertex Claude request
//      through into the 400.

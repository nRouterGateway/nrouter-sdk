// number. JavaScript makes that harder than it looks — `Number('')` is 0,
// `parseFloat('1.5abc')` is 1.5, `Number('NaN')` is NaN — so every numeric
// header goes through an explicit shape check before it is allowed to become
// a value. The Go SDK gets this for free from `strconv`; here it is written
// out, and each guard below names the failure it prevents.

// user can toggle in our own UI silently does nothing from npm.
//
// The nRouter field set is CLOSED — `extra_body_fields` in
// spec/nrouter-sdk-spec.json (Rule #14). The gateway strips the fields it knows
// and forwards the rest to the provider, so a field this SDK invents is not an
// error a caller ever sees: it is a dead option that looks live.
//
// `nrouter_guardrail_ids` WAS exactly that dead option, and it is now refused

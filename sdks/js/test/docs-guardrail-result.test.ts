// PGSDK-122. `docs/guardrails.md` explains at length how the gateway RESOLVES
// which guardrails run — scope precedence, the disabling assignment, caching —
// and then never tells the reader how to READ the outcome. It mentions neither
// `x-nr-guardrails` nor `meta.guardrails`, and none of the five statuses the
// gateway publishes.
//
// The cost of that omission is a specific wrong belief, and the doc actively
// teaches it: "failures refuse; they do not fall through" plus a Billing
// section about blocks reads as a two-state world — blocked is an error,
// anything else means you were protected. Two of the five statuses mean you
// were NOT protected:
//
//   none    — no guardrail was resolved for this request at all
//   monitor — the chain ran in observe-only mode and COULD NOT have refused
//
// A caller treating either as "pass" believes a policy is enforcing something
// it is not. That is the same class of defect as a fake surface: a control the
// dashboard shows as on, that changes nothing, with no way to tell from the
// response.
//
// docs/audio.md:155, docs/images.md:121 and docs/video.md:188 all already carry
// the `none | monitor | pass | partial | blocked` token, so the guardrails doc
// was the one place a reader looking specifically for guardrail semantics would
// land and find the least. Gateway source: preflight.rs documents the
// distinction.

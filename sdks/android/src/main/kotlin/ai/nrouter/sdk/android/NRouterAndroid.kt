/**
 * Android entry point for the nRouter SDK.
 *
 * The wire behaviour lives in `ai.nrouter.sdk.NRouter` and is shared with the
 * JVM. This object exists for one reason that is not cosmetic:
 *
 * **`System.getenv` does not work on Android.** It returns `null` for anything
 * an app did not inherit from a shell, so the core's `NROUTER_API_KEY` fallback
 * silently resolves to nothing on-device. Code that works in a unit test then
 * throws on a handset. [create] takes the key from somewhere Android actually
 * has it, and says so when it cannot.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * // In your Application or a ViewModel:
 * val client = NRouterAndroid.create(context)
 *
 * viewModelScope.launch {
 *     val result = client.chatCompletions(
 *         JSONObject()
 *             .put("model", "claude-sonnet-4-5")
 *             .put("messages", listOf(mapOf("role" to "user", "content" to "Hello!")))
 *     )
 *     // The SDK already hops to Dispatchers.IO, so this is main-thread safe.
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Do not ship a customer key inside the APK
 *
 * Anything compiled into an app — `BuildConfig`, a manifest `meta-data` entry,
 * a string resource — is readable by anyone who downloads it. A shipped key is
 * a published key. For a production app, mint a short-lived key on your own
 * backend and pass it to [create]; the manifest path is for internal builds and
 * prototypes, and [create] is deliberately explicit about that.
 *
 * ### Timeouts
 *
 * [create] never falls back to a bare `OkHttpClient()`. OkHttp's default read
 * timeout is 10 seconds, which is far below a normal LLM completion and far
 * below an image, video or TTS response — so on a handset the app would abort
 * requests the gateway completes, settles and BILLS, and the user would pay for
 * an answer they were shown as a failure. [defaultHttpClient] supplies the
 * bounds instead, and a caller can replace it wholesale.

     * The transport [create] builds when the caller injects none.

     * Deliberately the SHARED core factory, not a second set of numbers. Two
     * clients disagreeing about how long an inference may take is how one
     * platform starts cutting completions the other tolerates, and the wire
     * behaviour is already shared for exactly this reason.
     *
     * It carries no retry policy. The gateway reserves credit once per customer
     * request and owns retry and failover; a client retry of a billed POST is a
     * second call and a second bill, which on a flaky mobile network is the
     * easiest possible way to charge a user twice.

     *  2. `<meta-data android:name="ai.nrouter.sdk.API_KEY" .../>` in the
     *     manifest — convenient for internal builds, and readable by anyone
     *     holding the APK.
     *
     * @param http the transport. Defaults to [defaultHttpClient]; pass your own
     *   to control proxy, TLS, connection pool or timeouts, and it is used
     *   verbatim — the SDK layers nothing back on top of it.
     * @throws NRouterError.Configuration when neither supplies a usable key.

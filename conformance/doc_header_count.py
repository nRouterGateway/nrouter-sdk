"""Refuse a HARD-CODED response-header count in customer-facing prose.

SDKDOC-001. Seven documents said the gateway emits "fourteen" `x-nr-*` headers.
`ef1805845` shipped `x-nr-guardrails` and made it fifteen, and every one of
those sentences went wrong at once — on the only PUBLIC repo in the workspace.

The defect is not the number. It is that a DERIVED quantity was restated as
prose. The list comes from the gateway's `nr_headers::all_emitted_names()` and
moves whenever a header ships, so any snapshot of it is guaranteed to rot; the
same reactive-staleness pattern as STALEGUARD-001 and as the cron registry
count, which this workspace has now restated wrongly four times.

So this gate does not check that the number is RIGHT — that would just be the
same snapshot one layer down, and it would go green the day someone updates the
prose and stale again the day after. It refuses the number's PRESENCE. The
machine-readable side is already correct and already gated:

  * `spec/gateway-response-headers.json` carries the list and names its source,
  * `conformance/check_conformance.py` enforces list-entry-plus-parse-site per
    SDK,
  * `tests/test_sdk_contract.py` asserts spec parity against the derived list.

Prose that restates a gated, derived number adds nothing it can be trusted for.
Say "every" / "all" / "the full set", or point at the JSON.

#
# The `|` exclusion is load-bearing, not tidiness. Without it this fired on
# `sdks/js/docs/test-coverage-and-issues.md`, whose table row
# `| meta.test.ts | 16 | All \`x-nr-*\` response headers, ... |` counts TESTS,
# not headers. A gate that fires on correct text is the TENANCY-002 failure
# shape — it trains people to ignore it — so a cell boundary ends the span.
# The comma exclusion is the second half of the same lesson. Without it this
# fired on `LANGUAGES.md`'s "the gateway's nine codes, and every x-nr-* header"
# — where `nine` counts ERROR CODES and the header clause is already honest.
# A comma or a `|` ends the clause, so a count belonging to a different noun
# cannot be dragged across into this one.
#
# BOTH ORDERS. The first pattern is the shape that actually shipped ("all
# fourteen `x-nr-*` headers"). The second is its mirror — "the `x-nr-*` headers
# total 15", "x-nr-* headers: 15 of them" — which reads just as naturally and
# which the first pattern cannot see, since it requires the number FIRST. A
# gate that refuses the count's PRESENCE has to refuse it in the order a person
# would actually write it, not only in the order the last defect used.
#
# RESID-008. A SENTENCE END closes the clause the same way a comma and a cell
# boundary do, and it is what makes joining a hard-wrapped block safe. The
# scanner reads LOGICAL lines now (`_logical_lines`), because "all fourteen
# `x-nr-*`" ended line 11 of `check_conformance.py` and "headers" began line 12
# -- a line-bounded pattern can never reach the noun it needs, so every claim
# an author wrapped was invisible, which is most of the long ones. But joining
# alone would weld two honest sentences into one false hit: "Retries default to
# three." followed by "`x-nr-request-id` headers correlate every attempt" reads
# as a hard-coded header count the moment the newline becomes a space. The `.`
# is the temper that keeps the join honest, and it costs nothing: a header name
# contains no period, and no count ever sat on the far side of a full stop from
# the noun it counted.

# it ends the span the same way a comma or a cell boundary does. Caught by
# running this pattern against the corpus it was written for — it went red on
# four honest lines before the temper was added.
# The mirror's gap ALLOWS a comma, unlike the forward one, because a comma is a
# normal separator inside this shape — "the `x-nr-*` headers, 15 in total" is
# the defect, not an unrelated clause. Two narrower tempers do the work the

#   * a CONJUNCTION ends the span, because it starts a new noun phrase. That is

#     counts the ERRORS, and this pattern went red on four honest lines before

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SDKENUM-001 — the SAME staleness, one level harder: a COMPLETENESS PROMISE
# followed by an ENUMERATION.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The count gate above refuses "all fourteen `x-nr-*` headers". `5f05390`
# obeyed it by writing "every `x-nr-*` header:" — and left the fourteen-item
# list standing underneath. That is STRICTLY WORSE than the count it replaced:
# "fourteen" was wrong but self-consistent, while "every" over a list of
# fourteen is an exhaustiveness claim a customer will act on, on the only
# PUBLIC repo in the workspace. `94d608c` repaired those five documents by
# hand; nothing stopped the sixth, and there WAS a sixth — `sdks/kotlin`'s
# table omitted `x-nr-guardrails` while `ResponseMeta.kt:44` exposed it.
#
# THIS GATE NEVER COMPARES HEADER NAMES, and that is the whole design.
# A first implementation did, and mis-fired two ways:
#
#   1. the Go README separates its promise from its table by a blank line and
#      an intervening sentence, so a same-paragraph window saw an empty list
#      and reported every header missing;
#   2. every SDK spells the fields its own way — `x-nr-request-cost` is `cost`
#      in dart/rust/r/swift and `Cost` in go — so a suffix match reported
#      headers missing from lists that DID contain them.
#
# Both are legitimate text. A gate that fires on correct text trains people to
# ignore it, which is the failure this repo already carries a card for. So the
# gate refuses the SHAPE instead: a completeness promise about the `x-nr-*` set
# with an enumeration under it. The shape is decidable from the document alone,
# so neither spelling nor layout can make it wrong.
#
# Either half may go, and the choice is editorial:
#
#   * a list that only restates field names carries nothing the naming rule and
#     `spec/gateway-response-headers.json` do not -> DROP THE LIST, keep the
#     promise. The promise is not a snapshot: `check_conformance.py` holds every
#     SDK to the derived header set, so "every" is machine-checked;
#   * a table that carries per-header SEMANTICS (what nil means, which status
#     narrows an error) is real documentation -> KEEP THE TABLE, drop the
#     completeness claim and cite the spec as authoritative. It then documents
#     what it documents and cannot rot into a lie when header sixteen ships.

# A quantifier that GOVERNS the header set. It must appear BEFORE the `x-nr-`
# marker: "every `x-nr-*` header" is a claim about the set, while "`x-nr-*`
# headers with every response" is a claim about frequency and is honest.
# "the following" is deliberately ABSENT and its absence is the rule, not an
# oversight. It is a DEICTIC pointer -- "these ones" -- not a quantifier over
# the set, so "The following `x-nr-*` headers are relevant to billing:" over a
# two-row table is honest PARTIAL documentation and refusing it is the
# false-positive failure this gate exists to avoid. "only the following" stays,
# because "only" is the quantifier that turns the pointer into a closed set.

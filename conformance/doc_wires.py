"""Prove every documented snippet calls a wire the gateway serves for its model.

Two independent failures live in the same corpus (`README.md`, `LANGUAGES.md`,
`examples/**`, `sdks/*/README.md`, `sdks/*/docs/**`), and both ship as
copy-pasteable code:

1. **Wire mismatch.** The gateway resolves a provider endpoint per wire, and a
   provider that declares no endpoint for a wire answers 404
   `model_unavailable_on_route` — the model exists, just not on the route it was
   asked for. Anthropic declares `messages` ONLY (`chat_completions: None`,
   `responses: None`), so a Claude id posted to `/v1/chat/completions` fails for
   a customer holding a valid key and a real model id, and reads as "nRouter is
   broken". Derive the gateway side rather than trusting this docstring::

       cd nrouter-rust-gateway
       grep -n "fn endpoints" -A 12 src/sdk/providers/anthropic/transformation.rs

2. **Unserved endpoint.** `spec/nrouter-sdk-spec.json` › `unsupported_endpoints`
   names the paths the gateway does not mount. A committed example that calls
   one is a documented 404.

The corpus is DOCUMENTATION, so this is a text gate by design: the snippets are
never executed, which is exactly why nothing else notices when they rot.

    python3 conformance/doc_wires.py             # check
    python3 conformance/doc_wires.py --self-test # prove the gate bites
